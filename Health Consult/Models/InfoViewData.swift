Over a hundred yeas later in 1891, the first documented and effective chest compression in humans was performed by Dr. Friedrich Maass. Through the years the use of external chest compression in humans resuscitations was attempted and analyzed, and it was proven that expired air by a rescuer is sufficient tho oxygenate an unresponsive person. CPR was then officially developed and instituted in 1960 and a program by the American Heart Assosciation (AHA) provided CPR training and encouraged the use of CPR by the general public. The American Red Cross and other agencies came on board to institute performance standards, standadized training, and certification for CPR for intervention of sudden cardiac arrest and acute life-threatening cardioplmonary problems.\n\nEvery five years the AHA guidelines for CPR and emergency cardiac care are reviewed, improved, and updated to improve survival rates of life-threatening events.

When a perosn is laying fuace up, the tongue may relax to the back of the throat and fluids such as blood or vomit can pool in the back of the throat and obstuct the airway. Also, in the face-up position, the esophagus is tilting down slightly from the stomach toward the throat, and when combined with loss of muscular control that occurs when someone is unconscious, this can lead to what is called passive regurgitation when the stomach contents flow up into the throat. Aside from airway obstruction, any fluid collecting in the back of the throat can flow down into the lungs and the acid from the stomach that is in that fluid can damage the lungs, a condition knows as aspirations pneumina. In many instances, the actual injury or illness that caused unconsiousness will not be fatal, but the sresulting passive regurgitation or aspiration pneumonia will be.\n\nA very common cause of death is excessive consumption of alcohol that leads to unconsciousness followed by all or some of these events.

Then position the other arm across the body, resting the hand across the torso.\n\n2.

Use your other arm to pull the shoulder farthest from you while rolling the body toward you.

The only reason to move a person with a suspected spinal injury into a recovery position is if you must drain voimt from the airway. And then you should use what is called HAINES modified recovery position (High Arm IN Endangered Spine). In this modified position, raise one of the injured person's arms above the head (in full abduction) while turning the person's body in order to support the head and neck for less nack movement.\n\nIn a suspected spinal or neck injury, your first priority is keeeping the airway open, so if the person is breathing, leave them in the position you found them. But if breathing stops, regardless of potential for increased injury to the person, you must continue ABCs: airway, breathing, and circulation. Breathing is the first priority; everything else is second.\n\nAn unconscious pregnant woman should always be posiotioned in the recovery positon on her left side, and anyone with wounds to the torso should be placed with the wounds closes to the ground to decrease any chance of blood pooling in the lungs.\n\nPlace a baby less than a year old in modified recovery position by holding the infant in your arms, head titled downward, in order to prevent the tongue from obstructing the airway or the infant from inhaling vomit.

The Heimlich maneuver is recommender for use in clearing a blocked airway in consious adults and children over the age of one; it is not meant to be used for choking infants under age one. The act of abdominal thust lifts the diaphragm and forces air from the lungs, similar to coughing action, so that the foreing body in an airway may be moved and expelled.\nThe steps to perform the Heimlich maneuver on a choking person are:\n\n1. Stand behind the person, wrap your arms around the waist, and tip the person slightly forward.\n2. Make a fist with one hand and place it slightly above the navel.\n3. Grasp your fist with your other hand and press forcefully into the abdomen with quick, upward thrusts, using force as if you were attempting to lift the person up.\n4. Continue the thrusts until the foreign body is dislodged.\n\nThe steps to perform the Heimlich maneuver on yourself if you are choking are:\n\n1. Place your fist just slightly above your navel.\n2. Grasp your fist with your other hand, bend over a hard surface like a chair or countertop, and thrust your fist inward and upward.\n\n To clear an airway obstruction of a pregnant woman or obese person, place your fists colser to the chest, right above the joining of the ribs at the base of the breastbone, and follow the Heimlich maneuver steps. When a choking person is unconscious, lower the person on her back onto the floor. Clear the airway using the head-tilt method. If you can see the blockage, reach a finger into the mouth and sweep it out (finger sweep), using caution not to push the object deeper into the airway. If you are unable to remove the obstructing object and the person doesn't respond, you must begin CPR. In this case, there is a chance that the chest compressions used in CPR will free the object so recheck the mouth at regular intervals.\n\nIn case of a choking infant younger than age one, sit with the infant face down on your forearm, positioned securely on your thigh. Thump the infant firmly and gently five times with heel of your hand in the middle of the back. The back blows and the gravity will most likely free the obstruction. If it doesn't work, turn the infant face up on your forearm, head lower than body, and use two fingers positioned over the center of the breastbone just below the nipples and give five quick chest compressions.

IN assessing the severity of a penetrating injury, it's important to understand that it may be life threatning depending that it may be life threatening depending on the type of object used, the location and depth of penetration, and the number of wounds.Knives and ice picks cause low-energy injuries becuase they are fro ma close distance, but one stab wound to the center of a person's chest, neck, or head with a large knife is obviously much more serious than many stab wounds with a smll knife to an arm or leg.\n\nFor any penetrating injuries to the head, chest , and neck, or a wound that cuases a person to fall, always suspect spinal injuries, and stabilize and protect the neck by holding the head firmly in place in line with the body. Assess for ABCs and manage as outlined in Emergency Response menu.\nFor chest wounds, not any potentially ominous sysmptoms, like shortness of breath and skin turning blue, along with pain in the chest and or back or the sound of airflow sucking or hissing through the puncture hole, referred to as a sucking chest wound.\n\nAt the same time, watch for any signs of what is referred to as \"flail chest,\" where an area of the chest draws in when the person inhales, while the rest of the chest expands, and the area moves outward as the person exhales, while the rest of the chest contracts.\n\nFor a sucking chest-wound injury, follow these steps:\n\n1.Don't remove clothing if it is stuck to the wound in a chemical environment and don't attempt to clean the wound.\n2.If you can, use the person's hand to cover the wound while you get some sort of occlusive dressing together. This can be any sort of plastic wrapper, aluminium foil, or duct tape, which should be placed to extend two inches past the edges of the wound so the patch won't get sucked back into the wound, and secured with adhesive tape.\n3.Only tape three sides, leaving one side untaped so that when the person exhales, air goues out of the chest cavity and is able to escape from the open edge of the patch. When the person inhales, the patch will stick to the sking, preventing further air from entering the chest cavity(this mehtod of patching helps to reinflate a collapsed lung.)\n4.Place a larger dressing loosely over the patch so it doesn't inhibit breathig, and roll the person careflly onto the injured side until help arrives.\n5.Apply a thick, bulky dressing to support a flailed chest injury.\n\nTry to chekc pulses at the wrist, groin, femoral, and finally the neck or carotid. If you can't feel a pulse at the carotid artery, you may need to begin CPR. Don't move the injured person unless his or her safety is in jeopardy; place unconsious persons in the the recovery position as outlined persons in the recovery positions as outlined in Emergency Response menu until help arrives.\n\nDon't clean up any blood on clothing, car seats, or the ground, because it's needed by first responders to estimate blood loss in order to report to the emergency department. Also, in cases of any violent crime including domestic violence, do not throw away or destroy any other evidence, including blood-stained clothing or any undergarments, obviously stained or not.\n\nAbove all, stay, practice universal precautions, and understand that injuries involving guns and other weapons may be in an area of potential danger to any rescuers or responders. You aren't any help to an injured person if you also get hurt.Always call emergency number first if you are clar that a gun is involved.

Labour can start any time after this although it could be as long as a few days.\n•Waters have broken.

Your doctor may recommend not putting any weight on the injured area for 48 to 72 hours, so you may need to use crutches. A splint or brace also may be helpful initially. But don't avoid all activity.\n\n.Even with an ankle sprain, you can usually still exercise other muscles to minimize deconditioning. For example, you can use an exercise bicycle with arm exercise handles, working both your arms and the uninjured leg while resting the injured ankle on another part of the bike. That way you still get three-limb exercise to keep up your cardiovascular conditioning.\n\n3.Ice the area. Use a cold pack, a slush bath or a compression sleeve filled with cold water to help limit swelling after an injury. Try to ice the area as soon as possible after the injury and continue to ice it for 15 to 20 minutes, four to eight times a day, for the first 48 hours or until swelling improves. If you use ice, be careful not to use it too long, as this could cause tissue damage.\n\n3.Compress the area with an elastic wrap or bandage. Compressive wraps or sleeves made from elastic or neoprene are best.\n\n4.Elevate the injured limb above your heart whenever possible to help prevent or limit swelling.\n\nSprains can take days to months to recover. As the pain and swelling improve, gently begin using the injured area. You should feel a gradual, progressive improvement. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), may be helpful to manage pain during the healing process.\n\nIt is essential to restore strength and stability to the injured limb prior to a return to sports or fitness activities. A physical therapist or other sports medicine provider can provide you with the appropriate strength and stability exercises to optimize healing and minimize the risk of repeat injury.\n\nThe injuries that cause sprains can also cause serious injuries, including fractures.
